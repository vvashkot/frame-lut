# LUTs Directory

This directory contains LUT files that will be included in the Docker image.
The actual .cube files are not committed to git (see .gitignore).

To add LUTs for deployment:
1. Copy your .cube files to this directory
2. Build and deploy the Docker image
3. The container will automatically import them on startup
